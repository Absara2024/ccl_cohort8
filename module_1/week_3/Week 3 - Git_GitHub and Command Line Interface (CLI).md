- [ ] Perform basic Git operations to manage version control in their projects.
- [ ] Use GitHub for hosting code repositories and collaborating with others.
- [ ] Navigate and execute basic tasks in the Command Line Interface.
- [ ] Apply CLI commands to work with Git and manage code versions efficiently.

#### Activities and Assignments

**Git Basics Workshop**
- **Objective**: Familiarize with Git for version control.
- **Activity**: Participate in a hands-on workshop exploring Git fundamentals and basic commands.
- **Deliverables**: Creation of a new Git repository, making several commits, and pushing changes to a GitHub repository.

**GitHub Collaboration Exercise**
- **Objective**: Understand the collaborative features of GitHub.
- **Activity**: Engage in a group exercise where students collaborate on a shared repository, including branching and merging changes.
- **Deliverables**: Contributions to a group project on GitHub, demonstrating the ability to manage merges and resolve conflicts.

**Command Line Interface (CLI) Training**
- **Objective**: Master basic CLI commands.
- **Activity**: Complete a series of tasks using the CLI to navigate the file system, create and edit files, and utilize Git commands.
- **Deliverables**: A log of CLI commands used to perform tasks, along with a brief explanation of each command.

**Week 3 Homework: GitHub Repository Setup and Terminal Commands**
- **Objective**: Practice using Git and the terminal to manage a GitHub repository.

- **Step-by-Step Guide**:
  1. Create a new repository on GitHub (no need to initialize it with a README or other files).
  2. Clone the repository to your local machine using the terminal.
  3. Inside the cloned repository, create a file (either `.txt` or `.md`) that lists the terminal commands we learned this week (e.g., `ls`, `cd`, etc.).
  4. Use Git to:
     - Add the file to the staging area.
     - Commit the changes with a meaningful commit message.
     - Push the changes to the GitHub repository.
  5. Copy the repository URL from GitHub.

- **Deliverables**: Submit the URL of your GitHub repository containing the file with terminal commands to the LMS.
